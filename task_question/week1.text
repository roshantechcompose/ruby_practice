Task: Create a Ruby program to manage a simple user profile and favorite items list.

Requirements:
1. User Input and Variables:
    * Ask the user for their name, age, and favorite color. Store these in appropriate variables.
    * Greet the user with a personalized message: "Hello [Name], aged [Age], who likes the color [Color]!"

2. Conditional Logic:
    * Check if the user is old enough to vote (18 years or older) and print a message:
      * "You are eligible to vote!" if they are 18 or older.
      * "You are not eligible to vote yet!" if they are under 18.

3. Looping and Arrays:
    * Ask the user to enter their five favorite foods, storing each food item in an array.
    * After collecting all five foods, print the entire list with each item on a new line.

4. Hashes and Symbols:
   * Create a hash to store the user's profile with the following keys: :name, :age, :color, and :favorite_foods.
   * Assign the previously gathered user data to the respective keys in the hash.

5. Iterating and Displaying Data:
   * Use a loop to display each key-value pair in the hash, formatted as:
     * Name: [Name]
     * Age: [Age]
     * Favorite Color: [Color]
     * Favorite Foods: [Food1, Food2, Food3, Food4, Food5]

6. Bonus: Dynamic Hash Addition:
   * Allow the user to add additional attributes to their profile dynamically. Prompt the user to enter a key and a value, convert the key to a symbol, and add it to the hash.
   * After each addition, print the updated hash.
